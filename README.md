Lumberjack API
This project is a .net 6 Web API that allows you to submit logs in JSON and file formats, which are then stored in a SQL database and sent to an Azure Service Bus. It includes various features such as logging, authentication, authorization, documentation using Swagger, dependency injection, ORM, repository pattern, asynchronous methods, AutoMapper with profiles, and pagination.

Features
Logging
The API provides robust logging capabilities, allowing you to capture and store logs in various formats. Logs can be submitted as JSON or file uploads, providing flexibility in how you capture and process log data.

Authentication and Authorization (JWT Tokens, Claims)
Authentication and authorization are implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users can obtain a token by providing their credentials, and subsequent requests to protected endpoints require this token in the Authorization header. Claims can be used to grant or restrict access to certain resources based on user roles or permissions.

Documentation (Swagger)
The API includes Swagger documentation, which provides a comprehensive and interactive user interface for exploring the available endpoints, their parameters, and responses. Swagger makes it easy to understand and test the API's functionality without requiring external tools.

Dependency Injection
The project employs the dependency injection pattern to manage and resolve dependencies between classes. This promotes loose coupling, improves testability, and allows for easier extensibility and maintainability of the codebase.

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework is used to interact with the SQL database. This simplifies data access by abstracting away the low-level database operations and allowing developers to work with objects and entities instead.

Repository Pattern
The repository pattern is implemented to provide a separation between the data access logic and the rest of the application. It encapsulates the data access operations, making it easier to switch between different data sources or storage mechanisms without impacting the higher-level code.

Asynchronous Methods
The API leverages asynchronous methods to improve performance and scalability. By using asynchronous operations, the server can handle more requests concurrently and efficiently utilize system resources, leading to better responsiveness and scalability.

AutoMapper (and Profiles)
AutoMapper is utilized to simplify the mapping between different data models and entities. It eliminates the need for manual mapping code, reducing boilerplate and improving development productivity. AutoMapper profiles are used to define specific mappings between source and destination types.

Pagination
To handle large datasets, pagination is implemented in the API. It allows clients to request a specific subset of results, reducing the amount of data transferred over the network and improving performance. Pagination parameters such as page size and offset can be provided to control the returned results.

Getting Started
